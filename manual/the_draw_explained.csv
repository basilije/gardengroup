"NOTES:",,,,,,,,,,
"This is a diagram of the MCP3008's connection to the Raspberry Pi 3B+ with the enabled Hardware Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",,,,,,,,,,
" A Hardware SPI should probably be enabled if not.",,,,,,,,,,
"There is also the option to connect the MCP3008 to a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with SPI software where CLK, DOUT, DIN and CS / SHDN can be assigned to any free digital GPIO pins.",,,,,,,,,,
"CH0-CH7 on MCP3008 are 8 input channels for the devices with analog output.",,,,,,,,,,
"The rest of the unused GPIO channels, if set as the GPIO output channel, could be used to control any device that can be managed this way.",,,,,,,,,,
"If any of the free GPIO channels are set as the input GPIO channel, they can be used to read additional input devices.",,,,,,,,,,
"The software algorithm looks pretty simple.",,,,,,,,,,
"It is necessary to measure one thing from the input devices and turn on or off another one on the output channel with known criteria when necessary.",,,,,,,,,,
"This criteria and other settings should be defined in the configuration files, and changes to some of the criterion parameters should be enabled during application operation.",,,,,,,,,,
